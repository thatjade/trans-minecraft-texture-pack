Updated to make the Hearts work again! The Title now also looks less out of place (Sorry for no non existant Upscale Skills)
The Resource Pack shows as in 1.12.3 no incompatibility. 



This texture pack was made by u/lazygott aka Audrey

Just put the folder in %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks

Some people who submitted ideas
unnamed discord server: a lot of them
u/PixelatedChar: Idea for trans coloured spider eyes
u/BragBirch: Idea for trans coloured shields


Borrowed Textures:
Fox: minecraft fox thigh highs: by @whoakden
Ender Pearl and Eye of Ender: by Insanity? or something (this is how they asked to be credited, word for word)


REAL BIG SPECIAL THANKS TO /u/Thomas_Crafty. They brought a lot of attention to the texture pack and I really needed a boost in motivation! Thank you!
